# HubPressSupport
Personal repo for support documentation of HubPress. This repo was created in order to keep better track of documentation until the proper doc pages can be created.

## Wiki
These files will be written on my GitHub first and then will be transferred to the wiki on the HubPress. Obviously you can just edit the wiki if you wish to or you can push to this repo and I will curate your document for grammar and spelling mistakes. Following the revision I will add your contribution to the Wiki.
